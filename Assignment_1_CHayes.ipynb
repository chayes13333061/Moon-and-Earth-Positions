Ironically, we are closest to the sun in our winter months and furthest away during our summer months. This seemed contradictory, however NASA confirms that it is the angle of the earths tilt that produces the seasons rather than our proximity to the sun. **https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/**\n",

I can conclude from this data that temperatures of the earth do not depend on the distance of the earth to the sun.
